Load dataset with pandas

Explore label distribution (ham vs spam)
âœ… youâ€™ve already finished this

Step 2. Preprocessing (Text â†’ Numbers)

Use TfidfVectorizer to convert text into numerical features

Understand the shape of the matrix (messages Ã— words)
ðŸ”„ youâ€™re working on this now

Step 3. Train a Baseline Model

Split data into train/test

Train a Logistic Regression model

Check accuracy on test set

Step 4. Evaluate the Model

Print precision, recall, F1-score

Show confusion matrix (where the model makes mistakes)

(Optional) Plot ROC curve

Step 5. Save & Reuse the Model

Save trained model with joblib

Load it back and test on new messages

Step 6. Build a Streamlit App

Make a small UI with a text box

Paste a message â†’ app predicts Spam / Not Spam

Show confidence score + top keywords
